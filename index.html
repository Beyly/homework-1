        <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> <font color="blue">(HTML)</font> is the
        standard <u>markup language<sup>[a]</sup></u> for documents designed to
        be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of
        web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> <font color="blue">(HTML)</font> and
        scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

        documents from a web server or from local storage and render the

          describes the structure of a <u>web page</u> semantically and

        In <b>1980</b>, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at <b>CERN</b>,
        proposed and prototyped <b>ENQUIRE</b>, a system for
        <b>CERN</b> researchers to use and share documents. In <b>1989</b>,
        Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.<sup>[4]</sup>

        That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
        collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
        formally adopted by <b>CERN</b>. In his personal notes of <b>1990</b>,
        Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used";
        an encyclopedia is the first entry. <sup>[5]</sup>
